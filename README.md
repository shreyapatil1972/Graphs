Bar chart:A bar chart is a common type of chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars 
           with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. Matplotlib provides a simple interface for creating bar charts through the bar function. 
Histogram:A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It consists of a series of contiguous rectangles ("bins") that
          represent the frequency or relative frequency of data points falling into each bin. 
Scatter Plot:A scatter plot is a type of plot that displays values for two variables as points on a Cartesian coordinate system.
             Each point on the plot represents the values of the two variables. Matplotlib provides the scatter function to create scatter plots.
stack Plot:A stack plot (or stacked area plot) is a type of plot that displays the evolution of a set of variables over time, where each
           variable contributes to the whole. Matplotlib provides functionality to create stack plots using the stackplot function.
Pie chart:A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic that is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. In Matplotlib, you can create pie charts using the pie function.
Box Plot:A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical method for visualizing the distribution of a dataset through its quartiles.
         It displays the five-number summary of a dataset: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. Matplotlib provides the boxplot function to create box plots. 
Heatmap:A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where values are depicted using a color scale. It is often used to visualize matrices or tables of data, where each cell's 
         color represents the value in the corresponding position of the matrix. Matplotlib provides the imshow function to create heatmaps.
